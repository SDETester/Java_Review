package name: week05_review


Method: a function

    Syntax:
                                      (MUST)       (MUST)
        Access-Modifier  Specifier  Return-Type  methodName(Parameters){

                // Code Fragments

        }

        Access Modifiers: public, protected, default, private

                    public: Always accessible

        Specifiers: static, final, abstract, synchronized

                    static: can be called through class name

        Return-Type: void, any data type

                    void: can not return any value from the method
                    not void: method MUST return a value
                                 data type we gave will decide what kind of value will be returned from the method

        method name: any name

        Parameters: any data type

                    a data the method MUST have otherwise the method can not perform its task




Tasks
    1. Create a method named calculate that accespt three arguments:
            1. num1 (double)
            2. operator (char)
            3. num2 (double)

        if the operator is +:
                the method should return the addition of the two numbers

        if the operator is -:
                the method should return the subtraction of the two numbers

        if the operator is *:
                the method should return the multiplication of the two numbers

        If the operator is /:
                if denominator is NOT zero:
                    then the method should return the division

        for any other operators, the method should return 0


jump statements:

    continue: jump to the next iteration of the loop. skips the current iteration
                THERE MUST BE A LOOP

    break: exits the loop or switch
                when we need to forcefully to exit a loop

    return: exits the current method.
                Can also be used to return a value from a return method

    System.exit(1): terminates the program.



Loop: Repeated Action


    For Loop: used for fixed number of repitition
